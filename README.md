# Library Web System
A project created for Computer Graphics and User Interfaces classes at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology. 

The application aims to provide easy and intuitive interface for user to browse, search and rate books they read, or mark the ones they plan to. Data on books are provided via OpenLibrary API, a free database of millions of books.

Books in the application can be searched by queries like name, author or ISBN, can be rated. Users can also see recommendations based on what they read before.
